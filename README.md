# TPM-FX

This is The FX library for TinyPixelMapper
It uses FastLED 

It is designed so that you can allways select where to put the effect on. So you need to specify a start led and the number of leds.
There are also Mixing functions.


Im still looking for more cool FX  and Mixing functions to add to this library if you have any id be happy to add them.


Have fun with it.
